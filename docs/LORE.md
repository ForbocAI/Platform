# Forboc.AI Platform Lore

Canon consolidated from **quadar.md** (Qua'dar TTRPG), **forboc.github.io** (Forging Through the Eldritch), and **qvht.github.io** (Qvht daemon place).

## quadar.md — Qua'dar TTRPG Canon

### Core Lore
- **Umbralyn** — The fallen dimension; once pinnacle of ancient gnosis and forbidden sciences. The Astral Empire grew in harmony with chthonic frequencies. When advanced Umbralyn shattered, the Abyssal Void invaded.
- **Goetéian Chthonica** — The chthonic force watching and waiting. Steady voices guiding the chronicler. *"Yet living on in other reaches, Goetéian Chthonica watches and waits."*
- **Qua'dar Tower (Migdal Kudar)** — Central monolith, beating heart of Umbralyn's circuitry. The Quadrangle is the central hub where the Merchant dwells.
- **Kamenal** — The protagonist: interloper, ranger, nomadic chronicler, starweaver with affinity for dimensional anomalies. *Guided by the lingering echoes, driven by the steady voices of Goetéian Chthonica.*
- **the churning of ages and eons past and yet to come** — Recurring temporal phrase.
- **Rift-laden Realm, the Many** — World of the disaffected.
- **Ethereal Towerlands** — High places, vineyards of the alien tower.
- **Abyssal Murk** — Watery northern expanse echoing with alien wails.

## GoeteianChthonica.md — The Sterile Chamber

*Source: Transcribed from Facebook Page Posts (September 15, 2023)*

The **Sterile Chamber** is an operating theater where clinical precision meets chthonic revelation. An operating table etched with archaic glyphs pulsates with silent power. When the scalpel meets skin, it perforates not merely tissue but the veil between worlds—whispers of the abyss seep through, and ethereal specters born of forgotten eras emerge.

- Layers traversed are not of flesh but of time and space; each stratum reveals deeper abysses.
- Mournful cries of trapped spirits reverberate. Entities, ageless and vast, scrutinize from beyond.
- The inscribed floor resonates with energies bridging clinical methodology and forbidden rites.
- Instruments hum with otherworldly resonance; anatomy, spirit, and the arcane intertwine.
- As the final suture seals not just an incision but a portal, the cosmos holds its breath.
- The ensuing silence bears the heaviness of aeons—truths too vast for the human psyche to comprehend.
