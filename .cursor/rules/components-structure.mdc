# Component structure (Platform)

## Folders

- **components/elements/generic** — Reusable primitives (buttons, modal, overlay, stat box). No domain types.
- **components/elements/unique** — Domain components by subdomain: `game/`, `narrative/`, `shared/`.
- **components/screens** — Full-page screens; one folder per screen (e.g. `GameScreen/`).

## Composition

- **Screens** — As much as possible, screens are made of **unique** and **generic** components. Prefer screen sub-components that use unique/generic. Extract inline UI into unique components.
- **Unique** — As much as possible, unique components are made of **generic** components (Modal, GameButton, NavButton, StatBox, LoadingOverlay).
- **Generic** — No imports from `features/game` or `features/narrative`; stay domain-agnostic.

## Imports

- Screens: `@/components/elements/unique`, `@/components/elements/generic`.
- Unique: `@/components/elements/generic` (and other unique as needed).
- Generic: no component imports; only lib/features for non-domain utils.

See `docs/COMPONENTS.md` for full details.
